## 📖 Introduction
Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that improve the performance of machine learning models. This repo covers various techniques such as:

- Handling missing values 🕵️‍♂️
- Encoding categorical variables 🔡
- Scaling & normalization 📊
- Feature extraction & selection 🎯
- Dimensionality reduction 📉
